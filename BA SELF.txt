q) WHY YOU CHOOSE THE COMPUTER SCIENCE
ANS = WHAT I UNDERSTANS SIR THAT , THERE IS NO REQUIRMENT OF ANY SUBJECT TO BECOME AN COMPUTER SCIENCE 
IRRESPECTIVE OF ANY BRANCH COMP SCI CAN BE IMPLEMENTED 

PROPER ANALYTICS =  ETL TESTING = DECISION MAKING 

QULITY FACTORS::

1 ) COUSTMER REQUIRMANT
2 ) COUSTMER EXPECTATION

THS TWO FACTOR ARE INMPORTANT IN TESTING PROSPECTIVE



3)  PRICE OF SOFTWERE
4) TIMELY DELIVERABLE 
5) RISK MANAGMANT ::  IF SOME PROBLEM COMES THEN HOW TO SOLVE IT

INTENET OF SPPECH : MEANS REQIRMENTS AND THERE SPECIFIACTION
	=============================================
Q) what is the significansce of testing ?

ans = quility defines various parameter .i.e.
      1) coustmere requirment 
      2) coustmer expectatipon 
Q) why you prefer as tester not devoloper ?
ans = 
     sir what i undestand the in last few years back the market
 follows the monopoly system  and in current situvation market 
 follws the oligopoly system that means huge compition and 
it means to survive in the market ,organsisatiom has to deliver 
 a good product and to achive the quality product organisation
has to concentrate on testing 

Q) what are the two apporeces that are used to achive the quilty
 product

ans = 1) design roboust code 
      2)  remove all defect 

approche two is practically  possible
the test eniginner is responible to improvise the code 


Q) what is the ratio of testr and devo in it company ?

ans = this is for web application it is 3:1  .i.e. devoloper : tester

and for ai and ml the ratio is 1: 7
